Key Changes:

    input is now required: The input argument is required by default, because we did not use a default_value_t or
     any required attribute. clap will automatically treat it as required if it doesn't have a default value.

    The user will need to provide the input argument, otherwise, clap will automatically show an error message and the program will terminate.
